Made it to the color "waterfalls," and don't know what to do now?

Jump under a waterfall to change to that color. Now go back
through the door, and retrace your steps to the room
with that color chest. Make sure the chest is in focus, then
stand on it. 

Unleash the color to all five rooms, and you'll see the credits.


The colors are arranged in reverse order of the rooms, so my 
suggestion would be to start by turning purple, visiting 
the room immediately before the waterfalls, coming back, 
then changing to green, etc. moving from right to left. 

Every time you unleash color on a room, come back to the waterfall 
room, get the next color, and so on, until you end by unleashing 
color on the room you started the game in.
