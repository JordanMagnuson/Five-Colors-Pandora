GENERAL INFO
------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONTROLS: Arrow keys (or WASD)

F4 to toggle fullscreen

If you need to pause the game for some reason, just alt-tab
it into the background.

If you get stuck in a wall or something because of a bug, you can also 
use the "N" and "P" keys to to jump between levels, but these keys
are not intended to be used during regular play. ("N" goes to next level
"P" to previous. If a bug stops you, try hitting "P", and then "N"
to get back to where you were).

COMPLETION: 
The game is not over until you see the credits screen.
